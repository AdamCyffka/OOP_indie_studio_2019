# Indie Studio

Welcome to our indie studio !
A student project realized by 6 students.

## Installation

Windows : generate the Visual Studio solution by using CMake, then make sure to set the target "bomberman" as the start-up project on Visual Studio.

Linux : generate the Makefile by using CMake, then compile the project by using the generated Makefile.

Alternative : you can use the following command to generate and run the program when you are at the root of the project (from Unix terminal or Windows cmd) : `cd build ; cmake .. && cmake --build . --config Release && ./bomberman ; cd ..`
